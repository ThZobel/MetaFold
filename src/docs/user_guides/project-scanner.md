- Increase scan depth if projects are deeply nested
- Verify file permissions allow reading project directories

**‚ùå Scan Takes Too Long**

*Symptoms*: Scan never completes or takes excessively long

*Solutions*:
- Reduce scan depth to limit directory traversal
- Exclude large irrelevant directories (system folders, backups)
- Use performance mode for faster scanning
- Scan smaller directory subsets

**‚ùå Incomplete Project Information**

*Symptoms*: Projects found but missing metadata or details

*Solutions*:
- Check that metadata files are valid JSON
- Verify metadata files have proper read permissions
- Look for corrupted or partial metadata files
- Re-scan with detailed analysis mode enabled

**‚ùå Visualization Errors**

*Symptoms*: Cannot create visualizations or they appear incorrect

*Solutions*:
- Ensure sufficient projects selected for meaningful visualization
- Check that relationship data is available
- Try different visualization types
- Reduce dataset size for complex visualizations
